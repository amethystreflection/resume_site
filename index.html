            <h3>Career Objective</h3>
            <div class="item">
                <p>Front-End web developer with six years of professional experience in ecommerce and additional experience as a hobbyist since childhood. I work to write, test, and maintain quality web pages while still meeting tight deadlines. I am experienced in working within the Agile methodology and can pivot and collaborate with ease. I am equally passionate about working with people as I am about working with code, and I ultimately view the development and maintenance of a website as a team effort. As a result, I communicate and collaborate with my teammates to the best of my ability. I am passionate about the experience and happiness of the end-user, so I strive to maintain ADA compliance and to ensure that my creations are responsive and easy to use.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Built responsive landing pages on Havertys.com based on mock-ups sent down from the marketing department. I then collaborated with the marketing department to ensure that the end results looked exactly how they wanted and made any corrections they requested.</li>
                    <li>Aided in the transition from WebSphere to AEM by not only helping with development and testing of the new Havertys.com, but also instructing members of the marketing department on how to use AEM.</li>
                    <li>Created AEM components to serve as building blocks that our marketing department could leverage to build pages quickly in the AEM author user interface.</li>
                    <li>Maintained React code on the site and worked with back-end developers to grab the appropriate data from the GraphQL schemas that they had written.</li>
                    <li>Wrote a Node.js script which automatically tested the performance of select pages of the website via PageSpeed Insights and placed the scores and timestamp into a CSV file.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated with teammates to perform regression tests before pushing new code. This testing was completed using both manual and automatic methods.</li>
                    <li>Wrote Cucumber scripts to automatically test the functionality of various pages on the site.</li>
                    <li>Spot-checked and maintained existing Cucumber and Selenium testing scripts.</li>
                    <li>Sought out and documented reproduction routes for known bugs on the site so that we could then go in and fix them.</li>
                    <li>Advocated for and helped to implement ADA compliance in both the functionality and the design of Havertys.com.</li>
